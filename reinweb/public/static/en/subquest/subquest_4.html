<p>
Hello, and thank you for playing NieR Re[in]carnation.  <br />
This is a message from the management team.<br />
<br />
Since you have completed the Main Quest on Hard difficulty, the sub-quest <span class="text-red">Dark Memory</span> has been unlocked.

<h3>Dark Memory</h3>

<p>
Dark Memory is a special sub-quest type that can be unlocked by completing each chapter of the <span class="text-red">Main Quest</span> on Hard difficulty.<br />
Completing each chapter on Hard difficulty will earn you a <span class="text-red">special weapon</span>.<br />
By evolving this special weapon to its final stage, you can get a <span class="text-red">special character</span>.<br />

<h3>Weapon Manifestation</h3>

</div>

<p>
In certain evolutionary stages of special weapons, a special process called <span class="text-red">manifestation</span> occurs.<br />
When manifested, the special weapon's <span class="text-red">appearance will change</span> and a <span class="text-red">special story</span> will play.<br />
<br />

The evolution (manifestation) of special weapons requires special materials.<br />
These materials can be obtained mainly through the Dark Memory sub-quests, which include the <span class="text-red">EX Summon Ticket Quests</span>, <span class="text-red">Dark Coin Quests</span>, <span class="text-red">Dark Trial</span>, and <span class="text-red">Dark Lair</span>.
</p>

<h3>Quest Types</h3>
<h4>EX Summon Ticket Quests</h4>
<p>
From these quests, you can obtain both common and special weapon-exclusive evolvement materials, as well as <span class="text-red">EX Summon Tickets</span> that allow you to use the Dark Memory Chapter Summons. Fulfill the unlocking conditions to unlock quests with higher difficulties and more rewards.
</p>

<br />
<h4>Dark Coin Quests</h4>
<p>
You can get items like <span class="text-red">Dark Coins</span> to exchange for items in the Dark Coin Exchange. Fulfill the unlocking conditions to unlock quests with higher difficulties and more rewards.
</p>

<br />
<h4>Dark Lair</h4>
<p>
You can challenge the Dark Lair <span class="text-red">once a day</span>.<br />
<span class="text-red">You can get a lot of items with a single attempt</span>, as well as <span class="text-red">rare materials</span> needed to evolve special weapons.
</p>

<br />
<h4>Dark Trial</h4>
<p>
The evolutionary stage of your special weapon determines the difficulty of the Dark Trial boss quest. <span class="text-red">The higher the evolution stage, the more difficult the trial becomes</span>.<br />
By conquering the Dark Trial, you will be able to unlock higher levels of the EX Summon Ticket Quest, Dark Coin Quest, and Dark Lair.<br />
<span class="text-red">Acquire a special character by completing the top-level Dark Trial</span>, which is unlocked after the final manifestation of the special weapon.
