<h3>About Recollections of Dusk</h3>
<div class="info-largeimage">
<img src="/images/en/operations/banner/8cdcf6d1d040ead4e9dbf063c9e29dae6489346f294d2c90e9e0553f5c0dd41a">

<p>
<span class="text-red">Recollections of Dusk</span> are <span class="text-red">high-difficulty quests in which you can see special character stories, and get limited-time costumes and weapons</span>.<br />
Each level consists of multiple quests. <span class="text-red">Costumes and weapons used to complete quests cannot be used in other quests in the same level.</span><br />
<br />
These quests can be challenged at any time.<br />
Recollections of Dusk quests for each character will be added periodically.<br />

<h3>About Chamber of Dusk</h3>
<div class="info-largeimage">
<img src="/images/en/operations/banner/3c38e75a13121904ce8370540d8a23beec902c9813f46133e49fb4c47b5a722e">
</div>
<p>
Chamber of Dusk is an area where you can <span class="text-red">challenge up to five doors of special quests</span>.<br />
The quests can be accessed in any order from their respective doors, except for the central door, which can be accessed after all of the other quests have been completed.<br /><br />
Quests can be accompanied by two types of restrictions: One which specifies characters that must be included in your deck, and one which specifies required affinities, which relate to the proficient affinities that correspond to each costume.<br />
<br />
Once a quest has been completed, the costumes and weapons included in the deck used to complete it cannot be used for any other quests on that same floor.<br />
If you find yourself stuck, you can reset the clear status of a quest and challenge it again with different costumes and weapons.<br>
<br>
* There is one exception to this rule: On floors with restrictions that stipulate required affinities, weapons alone can be included in decks used for multiple quests within a single floor.
* Resetting a quest's clear status means you will have to clear it again.<br />
* Resetting a quest's clear status will lock the central door if you have previously unlocked it, and you will be unable to play it.<br />
* Fulfilling the clear conditions again will unlock the central door again.

<h3>About Area Burdens and Barrier Skills</h3>
<div class="info-largeimage">
<img src="/images/en/operations/banner/c1956111622dacafd61533cd3d4ca1c268c9128f0b9c3d2a6651e0ed4800ccaa">
</div>
<p>
An area burden is a status which <color=#D29797>confers disadvantageous effects to the player</color>. These effects are active throughout an entire battle (though there are some that are active for only a limited amount of time) and <color=#D29797>come in two types: those that affect everyone, and those that affect just your party</color>.
 
To overcome these disadvantages, one should equip weapons possessing barrier skills that counteract area burden effects.
Note: The burden effect could also be time limited depending on the type of area burden/

There are different ranks for barrier skill and the <span class="text-red">burden effect could be reduced</span> individually for each character based on the total rank of equipped weapons.<br />


Please check for more information regarding this reduction feature in the details of Area Burden on the screen confirming quest participations.</p>

<p>
Note: Barrier skills will take effect from both main and secondary weapons included in the loadout.<br />
Note: The rank of barrier skills could not be enhanced.<br />
Note: Barrier skills cap at rank 10, and its effects will remain the same even if the rank exceeds the cap.<br />
<br />
