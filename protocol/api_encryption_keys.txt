The API uses gRPC over HTTP 2.0 ('application/grpc') protocol, with the normal
Length-Prefixed-Message encoding. gRPC messages carry protobuf-encoded
messages that are additionally encrypted.

The encryption used is AES-128-CBC with the PKCS#7 padding, applied over the
whole body of the message.

The encryption keys used for the api.app.* endpoints, both requests and
responses:
    Key:  "1234567890ABCDEF" (ASCII string)
    IV:   "it8bAjktKdFIBYtU"

There's a second set of key material, but it's not yet known what it's used
for:
    Key: "6Cb01321EE5e6bBe"
    IV:  "EfcAef4CAe5f6DaA"

These keys are retrieved by the game from the EXIF data of the following files
in the APK:
    - /assets/Icon-60@2x.jpg (unknown keys)
    - /assets/Icon-60@3x.jpg (app.app.* keys)
