'Octo' is the system used for the asset retrieval.

The 'Octo key' needed for accessing the endpoints is specified as a string
literal within the game code, and is 'l488k2zmalogay245osa257ifw2lczq4'.

The 'Octo AES key' is also a literal, and appears to be 'st4q3c7p1ibgwdhm'

Octo list is initially downloaded from:
https://resources-api.app.nierreincarnation.com/v2/pub/a/<octo A value>/v/<octo D value>/list/0
The first 16 bytes is the IV, the rest is the data.

AES, CBC, PKCS#7 padding
The key = SHA256(the string result of the virtual method #4 of Octo_IOctoSettings, encoded as UTF-8)
The key size is likely 256 bits
Block size is 128 bits
The initial IV is md5('LvAUtf+tnz'), but it's probably not used


Octo 'A' value is e.g. 301,
Octo 'B' value is the 'client secret key'
Octo 'C' value is the 'client AES key'
Octo 'D' value is e.g. 300116832
Octo 'E' value is the environment URL'
Octo 'F' value is formatted from 'dark_{0}_{1}', where 0 - A value, 1 - D value

Potentially relevant setting:
settings/octo/octo_overwrite_config


+0 BlockSize - set by calling at +414
+1 FeedbackSize
+2 IV
+3 Key       - set by calling at +544 ; the difference is 16 pointers. 4 pointers per prop???
