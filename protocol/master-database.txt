A bulk of the non-asset game data is stored in the 'master database'.

It's downloaded by a plain UnityWebRequest from the following endpoint:

https://web.app.nierreincarnation.com/assets/release/<version>/database.bin.e

<version> - e.g, prd-us/20240128180453

the <version> is retrieved by the following gRPC call:
https://api.app.nierreincarnation.com/apb.api.data.DataService/GetLatestMasterDataVersion
With the usual HTTP headers, empty request data (no protobuf tuples), and with the
response of one string tuple with the ID=1 containing the version.

The database.bin.e file is encrypted with AES-128-CBC with the PKCS#7 padding,
applied over the whole file content. The encryption parameters used are as
follows:

Key: "6Cb01321EE5e6bBe"
IV:  "EfcAef4CAe5f6DaA"

These parameters are retrieved from the EXIF data of the following file in
the game APK: /assets/Icon-60@2x.jpg

The master database file is MessagePack-encoded, starts with the index of all tables
contained, and continues with the table data. See parse_database.rb for an example
of proper parsing.

Note that the database uses single block LZ4 compression (extension 0x63),
which is not widely supported across MessagePack implementations.
