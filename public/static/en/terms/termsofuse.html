                <br/>
                <br/>Overview
                <br/>
                <br/>These TOS explain the terms and conditions under which you agree to use the Services. Here are some key points covered by these TOS:
                <br/>
                <br/>• These TOS apply when you use the Services. Any updates to the TOS will also apply to you. If you do not agree, or want to end your agreement with us, you must uninstall the Application or discontinue use of the Services.
                <br/>
                <br/>• You may only use the Content (defined below) contained in the Services in connection with your permitted activities on the Services and not in an offline environment or in connection with another application or web site unless we explicitly permit it. 
                <br/>
                <br/>• You have no ownership in the Services or any virtual currency or virtual items used in the Services. You have only a limited license to use them pursuant to these TOS. All or part of the virtual currency or virtual items may be deleted or the operation of the Services may be terminated in our sole discretion, with or without notice to you. 
                <br/>
                <br/>• Except as set forth explicitly in our Privacy Policy, you and the Company do not have a confidential relationship due to your use of the Services or your communications to us through or related to the Services. You and the Company do not have a fiduciary or other special relationship.
                <br/>
                <br/>• Many types of disputes that may arise in connection with your access to and use of the Services are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tokyo District Court located in Tokyo, Japan.
                <br/>
                <br/>• The Company is providing the Services to you on an "as-is" basis, without any warranty of any kind, and our liability to you in connection with your use of the Services is very limited. There are many other limitations and disclaimers relating to your use of the Services. 
                <br/>
                <br/>If You Want to Use The Services
                <br/>
                <br/>Carefully read the terms under these TOS, as they constitute a written agreement between you and us which affects your legal rights and obligations.

                <br/>
                <br/>The business realities associated with operating the Services are such that, without the limitations set forth in these TOS we would not be able to make the Services available to you.
                <br/>
                <br/>In some instances, separate guidelines, rules, or terms of service or sale setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions for the Services will also apply to your use of the Services (in each such instance, and collectively, "Additional Terms"). To the extent there is a conflict between the TOS and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.

                <br/>The following policies govern the virtual currency ("Virtual Currency") offered by us to its customers using the Services.
                <br/>
                <br/>A. Introduction to the Virtual Currency. Virtual Currency may be redeemed by you for certain licensed digital items and online services in the Services.
                <br/>
                <br/>B. Virtual Currency Are Merely Licensed Virtual Goods and Have No Monetary Value. Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) are virtual goods licensed to users and owned at all times by the Company. The license may be revoked by the Company at any time in our discretion. Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) have no monetary value, and you do not have any personal property rights in the Virtual Currency (or virtual items and services they may be redeemed for). Therefore, Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) may not be traded for cash, currency or any form of property, license or rights except for the products and services that the Company chooses to offer you in its sole discretion. You may not transfer Virtual Currency (or virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) to any other person or entity or receive Virtual Currency (or virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) from any other person or entity for any reason unless explicitly authorized by the Company. Virtual Currency (and virtual items and services they may be redeemed for) may be deleted by the Company for any reason or no reason, with or without notice.

                <br/>C. Pricing and Purchasing. You may add Virtual Currency to your account by using the payment methods specified for the particular platform you are using to access the Services. You must be authorized to use the payment method chosen and, in the case of minors using a credit or debit card of a parent or guardian, your parent or guardian must expressly agree to allow the use of such payment method. The current prices for Virtual Currency will be available for viewing in the Services. The Company reserves the right to adjust the price for Virtual Currency at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice or reimbursement. You are responsible for the payment of any taxes or other charges relating to the purchase or redemption of Virtual Currency. You may not falsely notify your payment processor that you did not authorize any one-time or automatically recurring charge that you consented to previously. We reserve the right to ban those who commit "friendly fraud" from the Services.
                <br/>
                <br/>D. Limits. In order to protect your security and to deter fraud, the Company may impose limits on the amount of Virtual Currency that you may license per transaction, per day and/or per month. The Company may also limit the maximum amount of Virtual Credits Currency that you may hold in your account at any one time.
                <br/>
                <br/>E. Usage of Virtual Currency. You may redeem Virtual Currency for certain digital items and/or online services offered within the Services. Such digital items are also revocable licenses for which you have no property interest, and which may be discontinued or deleted at any time. The Company reserves the right to adjust the amount of Virtual Currency due for each digital item and online service at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice or reimbursement. Once redeemed, Virtual Currency will be deducted from your account balance and cannot be used again. You have no right to reverse a transaction once it is completed. However, if the Company determines that an incorrect price (in Virtual Currency) is identified for a digital item or online service, it reserves the right to reverse, adjust and/or nullify any such transaction.
                <br/>
                <br/>F. NO CASH REFUNDS. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW OR AN APPROPRIATE PLATFORM OWNER, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO RECEIVE A CASH REFUND FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL CURRENCY.

In other words, you may redeem Virtual Currency for as long as the Company chooses to make Virtual Currency redeemable for digital items and services, which the Company has no obligation to do. Accordingly, we encourage you to redeem Virtual Currency sooner rather than later.
                <br/>
                <br/>H. Improper Acquisition/Usage of Virtual Currency. You agree that the Company has the absolute right to manage and regulate the Virtual Currency and all licenses for digital items and services related thereto in its sole discretion. If the Company suspects any fraudulent, abusive or unlawful activity with respect to your Virtual Currency balance, or your acquisition of licensed digital items or Services associated therewith, then the Company may reduce or liquidate your Virtual Currency balance and/or any or all licenses for digital items and Services related thereto, or deactivate, suspend or terminate access thereto.

                <br/>I. Termination of　Account. If you (a) are banned for any reason, including violation of these TOS, or (b) voluntarily terminate your account, then the Company reserves the right to delete the account and all Virtual Currency and all licenses for items and services related thereto permanently.
                <br/>
                <br/>J. Changes to the Virtual Currency. We reserve the right to change the way that the Virtual Currency and all licenses for items and services related thereto operates, or to terminate the Virtual Credits System and all licenses for items and services related thereto altogether, at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice.

                <br/>
                <br/>10. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY OF COMPANY PARTIES.
                <br/>

                <br/>i. the Services (including the Content and the User-Generated Content);

                <br/>
                <br/>The foregoing limitations of liability will apply even if any of the foregoing events or circumstances were foreseeable and even if the Company Parties were advised of or should have known of the possibility of such losses or damages, regardless of whether you bring an action based in contract, negligence, strict liability, or tort (including whether caused, in whole or in part, by negligence, acts of god, telecommunications failure, or destruction of the Services).
                <br/>
                <br/>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages of the sort that are described above, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

                <br/>11. Waiver of Injunctive or Equitable Relief.
                <br/>
                <br/>IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SERVICES, CONTENT, USER-GENERATED CONTENT, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED USER-GENERATED CONTENT) OR A LICENSOR OF THE COMPANY.

If any provision of these TOS is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these TOS, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these TOS (which will remain in full force and effect).

The provisions of these TOS, which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to the Company in these TOS, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.
                <br/>
                <br/>I. Assignment. The Company may assign its rights and obligations under these TOS, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice. These TOS may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of the Company.
                <br/>
                <br/>J. No Waiver. Except as expressly set forth in these TOS, (i) no failure or delay by you or the Company in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies under will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of these TOS will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.
                <br/>
                <br/>K. Force Majeure. If, by reason of Force Majeure Event (defined below), the Company is delayed or unable, in whole or in part, to perform or comply with any of its obligations under these TOS, then it shall be relieved of liability and shall suffer no prejudice for failing to perform to the extent that the inability was caused by Force Majeure Event. In the event of a Force Majeure Event, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the situation and remove the cause of its inability to perform. Force Majeure Event means any acts of God, flood, fire or explosion, war, invasion, riot or other civil unrest; embargoes or blockades, national or regional emergency; strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, shortage of adequate power or telecommunications or transportation facilities.

                <br/>
                <br/>M. English Version. If the English version of these TOS conflicts with any other language version, the English version shall prevail.
